  abstract                 = {Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples.},

  abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods have emerged as the two main tools to sample from high dimensional probability distributions. Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a Levy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

The role of graphical methods is shown at each step of the analysis, not only in the early exploratory phase, but in the later stages, too, when comparing and evaluating models. All examples are based on freely available software: GGobi for interactive graphics and R for static graphics, modeling, and programming. The printed book is augmented by a wealth of material on the web, encouraging readers follow the examples themselves.

The model, a stochastic version of the Gompertz model, can be transformed into a linear Gaussian state-space model (Kalman filter) for convenient fitting to time series data. The model has a multivariate normal likelihood function and is simple enough for a variety of uses ranging from theoretical study of parameter estimation issues to routine data analyses in population monitoring. A special case of the model is the discrete-time, stochastic exponential growth model (density independence) with environmental-type process error and lognormal observation error.

We describe two methods for estimating parameters in the Gompertz state-space model, and we compare the statistical qualities of the methods with computer simulations. The methods are maximum likelihood based on observations and restricted maximum likelihood based on first differences. Both offer adequate statistical properties. Because the likelihood function is identical to a repeated-measures analysis of variance model with a random time effect, parameter estimates can be calculated using PROC MIXED of SAS.

We use the model to analyze a data set from the Breeding Bird Survey. The fitted model suggests that over 70% of the noise in the population's growth rate is due to observation error. The model describes the autocovariance properties of the data especially well.

While observation error and process noise variance parameters can both be estimated from one time series, multimodal likelihood functions can and do occur. For data arising from the model, the statistically consistent parameter estimates do not necessarily correspond to the global maximum in the likelihood function. Maximization, simulation, and bootstrapping programs must accommodate the phenomenon of multimodal likelihood functions to produce statistically valid results.},

Within degraded landscapes, remnant forests are potential seed sources that could enhance nearby forest succession. The spatial extent that forest can influence succession, however, remains largely unstudied. In abandoned agricultural lands in Kibale National Park, Uganda, recurrent fires have helped perpetuate the dominance of tall (2–3 m) grasses. We examined the effects of distance from forest and grassland vegetation structure on succession in a grassland having several years of fire exclusion. At 10 and 25 m from forest edge, we quantified vegetation patterns, seed predation, and survival of planted tree seedlings. Natural vegetation was similar at both distances, as was seed (eight species) and seedling (six species) survival; however, distance may be important at spatial or temporal scales not examined in this study. Our results offer insight into forest succession on degraded tropical grasslands following fire exclusion. Naturally recruited trees and tree seedlings were scarce, and seed survival was low (20% after 7 mo). While seedling survival was high (95% after 6 to 8 mo), seedling shoot growth was very slow (x̄= 0.5 cm/100 d), suggesting that survivorship eventually may decline. Recurrent fires often impede forest succession in degraded tropical grasslands; however, even with fire exclusion, our study suggests that forest succession can be very slow, even in close proximity to forest.},

The two questions of interest are thus: Is this system in a coevolutionary arms race (Dawkins and Krebs 1979); that is, will both host and pathogen continue to evolve antagonistically? Will the virus continue to control the rabbit in the future? We present a simulation model based loosely on previous host--pathogen models (Anderson and May 1979), but with detailed accounting of the virus titer in infected hosts, and using realistic estimates of the demographic parameters of the rabbit, including age structure and seasonally varying reproduction. For a single virulence grade, by varying the non-disease (or @'natural@') mortality of the rabbit, the age at first reproduction of the rabbit, and the virulence grade of the virus, we explored the parameter range for which the rabbit population is controlled. For the most prevalent grades of the virus, grades IIIB and IV, the virus can control the rabbit for most realistic values of natural mortality and age at first reproduction. However, control is dependent on both natural mortality and virus virulence. Since natural mortality varies both geographically and seasonally, the usefulness of the virus may vary geographically and seasonally, and management policies must be sensitive to this variation. When competing against several virus strains that together encompass the complete range of virulence seen in the field, a strain of grade IV virulence competitively excludes strains of all other grades. This competitively dominant grade is close to the most prevalent virulence grades seen in the field. We discuss possible mechanisms of coexistence, including local competitive exclusion with global persistence, variability in host resistance, high mutation rates, and trade-offs between within-host and between-host competitive ability. By examining the effects of flea transmission efficiency, we are able to show that, contrary to commonly held belief, whatever effect fleas have upon the outcome of selection on virulence cannot be due to differences in transmission efficiency between fleas and mosquitoes. Finally, by including host resistance, we improve our prediction of the most prevalent grade of virulence. We conclude that control of the rabbit by the virus is likely for the near future, but that until we understand the genetics of resistance in the rabbit and the relationship between resistance and virulence for different grades of virulence, for different grades of virulence, we cannot make a useful prediction of the long-term state of this system.},

A major component of identifiability analysis is determining the identifiable parameter combinations, the functional forms for the dependencies between unidentifiable parameters. Identifiable combinations can help in model reparameterization and also in determining which parameters may be experimentally measured to recover model identifiability. Several numerical approaches to determining identifiability of differential equation models have been developed, however the question of determining identifiable combinations remains incompletely addressed. In this paper, we present a new approach which uses parameter subset selection methods based on the Fisher Information Matrix, together with the profile likelihood, to effectively estimate identifiable combinations. We demonstrate this approach on several example models in pharmacokinetics, cellular biology, and physiology.},

Despite this interdependence, many empirical studies build largely on other empirical studies with little direct reference to relevant theory, suggesting a failure of communication that may hinder scientific progress. To investigate the extent of this problem, we analyzed how the use of mathematical equations affects the scientific impact of studies in ecology and evolution. The density of equations in an article has a significant negative impact on citation rates, with papers receiving 28\% fewer citations overall for each additional equation per page in the main text. Long, equation-dense papers tend to be more frequently cited by other theoretical papers, but this increase is outweighed by a sharp drop in citations from nontheoretical papers (35\% fewer citations for each additional equation per page in the main text). In contrast, equations presented in an accompanying appendix do not lessen a paper's impact. Our analysis suggests possible strategies for enhancing the presentation of mathematical models to facilitate progress in disciplines that rely on the tight integration of theoretical and empirical work.},

  abstract                 = {Analytical methods for predicting and exploring the dynamics of stochastic, spatially interacting populations have proven to have useful application in epidemiology and ecology. An important development has been the increasing interest in spatially explicit models, which require more advanced analytical techniques than the usual mean-field or mass-action approaches. The general principle is the derivation of differential equations describing the evolution of the expected population size and other statistics. As a result of spatial interactions no closed set of equations is obtained. Nevertheless, approximate solutions are possible using closure relations for truncation. Here we review and report recent progress on closure approximations applicable to lattice models with nearest-neighbour interactions, including cluster approximations and elaborations on the pair (or pairwise) approximation. This study is made in the context of an SIS model for plant-disease epidemics introduced in Filipe and Gibson (1998, Studying and approximating spatio-temporal models for epidemic spread and control, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 353, 2153-2162) of which the contact process [Harris, T. E. (1974), Contact interactions on a lattice, Ann. Prob. 2, 969] is a special case. The various methods of approximation are derived and explained and their predictions are compared and tested against simulation. The merits and limitations of the various approximations are discussed. A hybrid pairwise approximation is shown to provide the best predictions of transient and long-term, stationary behaviour over the whole parameter range of the model.},

The technique operates by embedding the models in a composite model parameterised by an integer k which identifies a switching time when dynamics change from one model to the other. Likelihood ratios can then be estimated from the posterior density of k using Markov chain methods. The techniques are illustrated by a simulation study involving an immigration-death model and validated using analytic results derived for this case. They are also applied to compare the fit of stochastic epidemic models to historical data on a smallpox epidemic. In addition to estimating likelihood ratios, the method can be used for direct estimation of likelihoods by selecting one of the models in the comparison to have a known likelihood for the observations. Some general properties of the likelihoods typically arising in this scenario, and their implications for inference, are illustrated and discussed.},

Their use is illustrated for the particular case where only susceptible, infective, and removed states are represented using simulated realizations of the process. By comparing estimated likelihoods with theoretical forms, in cases where these can be derived, or with known model parameters, we show that the methods can be used to provide meaningful estimates of parameters and parameter uncertainty.

  abstract                 = {There are two fundamental ways to view coupled systems of chemical equations: as continuous, represented by differential equations whose variables are concentrations, or as discrete, represented by stochastic processes whose variables are numbers of molecules. Although the former is by far more common, systems with very small numbers of molecules are important in some applications (e.g., in small biological cells or in surface processes). In both views, most complicated systems with multiple reaction channels and multiple chemical species cannot be solved analytically. There are exact numerical simulation methods to simulate trajectories of discrete, stochastic systems, (methods that are rigorously equivalent to the Master Equation approach) but these do not scale well to systems with many reaction pathways. This paper presents the Next Reaction Method, an exact algorithm to simulate coupled chemical reactions that is also efficient: it (a) uses only a single random number per simulation event, and (b) takes time proportional to the-logarithm of the number of reactions, not to the number of reactions itself. The Next Reaction Method is extended to include time-dependent rate constants and non-Markov processes and is applied to a sample application in biology (the lysis/lysogeny decision circuit of lambda phage). The performance of the Next Reaction Method on this application is compared with one standard method and an optimized version of that standard method.},

This argues the need for a better balance in the literature and in statistical teaching between techniques and problem solving strategies.'' Whether analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in observational studies, or developing predictive models, there are common problems that few regression texts address. For example, there are missing data in the majority of datasets one is likely to encounter (other than those used in textbooks!) but most regression texts do not include methods for dealing with such data effectively, and texts on missing data do not cover regression modeling.},

Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.},

  abstract                 = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them, or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

  abstract                 = {This book is very different from any other publication in the field and it is unique because of its focus on the practical implementation of the simulation and estimation methods presented. The book should be useful to practitioners and students with minimal mathematical background, but because of the many R programs, probably also to many mathematically well educated practitioners. Many of the methods presented in the book have, so far, not been used much in practice because the lack of an implementation in a unified framework. This book fills the gap. With the R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods become easy to use for practitioners and students. An R package called `sde' provides functionswith easy interfaces ready to be used on empirical data from real life applications. Although it contains a wide range of results, the book has an introductory character and necessarily does not cover the whole spectrum of simulation and inference for general stochastic differential equations. The book is organized in four chapters. The first one introduces the subject and presents several classes of processes used in many fields of mathematics, computational biology, finance and the social sciences. The second chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers new methods not available in other milestones publication known so far. The third one is focused on parametric estimation techniques. In particular, it includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions, generalized method of moments and other techniques. The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like nonparametric estimation, model identification and change point estimation. The reader non-expert in R language, will find a concise introduction to this environment focused on the subject of the book which should allow for instant use of the proposed material. To each R functions presented in the book a documentation page is available at the end of the book.},

Such models are natural to formulate and can be analyzed mathematically and numerically. However, difficulties associated with inference from time-series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis, based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system, reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies.},

  abstract                 = {In many infectious diseases, an unknown fraction of infections produce symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded, a fact that can seriously compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100. In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity, with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir (free-living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods, which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality, process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology of many infectious diseases.},

Simple simulation approaches to assessment consider only a single set of parameter values, but what is required is consideration of all more or less plausible combinations of parameters. Bayesian decision theory is an appropriate tool for such assessment. I contrast standard (frequentist) and Bayesian approaches to a simple regression problem. I use these results to calculate the probability of early population collapse for three data sets relating to the Palila, Laysan Finch, and Snow Goose. The Bayesian results imply much higher risk of early collapse than maximum likelihood methods. This difference is due to large probabilities of early collapse for certain parameter values that are plausible in light of the data. Because of simplifying assumptions, these results are not directly applicable to assessment. Nevertheless they imply that maximum likelihood and similar methods based upon point parameter estimates will grossly underestimate the risk of early collapse.},

Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly, computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an effective programming of the methods given in the book. While R programs are provided on the book website and R hints are given in the computational sections of the book, The Bayesian Core requires no knowledge of the R language and it can be read and used with any other programming language. },

  abstract                 = {We examine stochastic effects, in particular environmental variability, in population models of biological systems. Some simple models of environmental stochasticity are suggested, and we demonstrate a number of analytic approximations and simulation-based approaches that can usefully be applied to them. Initially, these techniques, including moment-closure approximations and local linearization, are explored in the context of a simple and relatively tractable process. Our presentation seeks to introduce these techniques to a broad-based audience of applied modellers. Therefore, as a test case, we study a natural stochastic formulation of a non-linear deterministic model for nematode infections in ruminants, proposed by Roberts and Grenfell (1991). This system is particularly suitable for our purposes, since it captures the essence of more complicated formulations of parasite demography and herd immunity found in the literature. We explore two modes of behaviour. In the endemic regime the stochastic dynamic fluctuates widely around the non-zero fixed points of the deterministic model. Enhancement of these fluctuations in the presence of environmental stochasticity can lead to extinction events. Using a simple model of environmental fluctuations we show that the magnitude of this system response reflects not only the variance of environmental noise, but also its autocorrelation structure. In the managed regime host-replacement is modelled via periodic perturbation of the population variables. In the absence of environmental variation stochastic effects are negligible, and we examine the system response to a realistic environmental perturbation based on the effect of micro-climatic fluctuations on the contact rate. The resultant stochastic effects and the relevance of analytic approximations based on simple models of environmental stochasticity are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Given a time series of annual catch and effort data, models in the Deriso-Schnute family predict exploitable biomass in the following year from biomass in the current and previous year and from past spawning stock, A state-space model is used, as it allows incorporation of random errors in both the biomass dynamics equations and the observations. Because the biomass dynamics are nonlinear, the common Kalman filter is generally not applicable for parameter estimation. However, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian approach can handle any form of nonlinear relationship in the state and observation equations as well as realistic distributional assumptions. Difficulties with posterior calculations are overcome by the Gibbs sampler in conjunction with the adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling algorithm.},

  abstract                 = {Virtually all studies investigating morphological plasticity have focused on how organisms change in response to treatments that are constant throughout the experiment but which have different means. In this study, we investigated the possibility that organisms can morphologically respond to other environmental parameters like the amount of environmental variability or environmental maximum. Sea urchin larvae adjust the length of their feeding structure, a band of cilia, in response to different mean food concentrations. We investigated whether sea urchin larvae are also capable of responding to environmental variability or maxima by rearing larvae on four fluctuating diets, where all treatments had the same mean concentration of food. Larvae reared on a low variable diet produced longer larval arms (i.e. a longer ciliary band) than larvae reared on more variable diets. This response is similar to the morphological change that occurs when the mean food concentration is reduced (small mean = long arms), and indicates that organisms can morphologically respond to environmental parameters other than the environmental mean - such as the amount of environmental variability or the environmental maxima. We also quantified the shape of the relationship between larval arm length and fixed food concentrations to determine whether our results might be explained by nonlinearity in this relationship (i.e. Jensen's inequality). The shape of the relationship was inconsistent with a Jensen's inequality explanation. In addition, sea urchin larvae were unable to track fluctuations in food concentrations. This inability to track our imposed environmental fluctuations indicates that there was a time delay greater than 2 days in the response of larvae to changes in food concentrations. Since plutei likely experience fluctuations in food concentrations at least once a day, it is possible that larvae cannot track natural fluctuations in food concentration. We discuss the importance of our results in light of adaptive interpretations of plasticity and predictions of morphological response.},

  abstract                 = {Coyotes and lynx are the two most important mammalian predators of snowshoe hares throughout much of the boreal forest. Populations of hares cycle in abundance, with peaks in density occurring every 8–11 yr, and experimental results suggest that predation is a necessary factor causing these cycles. We measured the functional responses of coyotes and lynx during a cyclic fluctuation of hare populations in the southwest Yukon, to determine their effect on the cyclic dynamics. We used snow-tracking and radio telemetry to examine changes in the foraging behavior of the predators.

Coyotes and lynx both fed mostly on hares during all winters except during cyclic lows, when the main alternative prey of coyotes was voles, and lynx switched to hunting red squirrels. Both predators showed clear functional responses to changes in the densities of hares. Kill rates of hares by coyotes varied from 0.3 to 2.3 hares/d, with the most hares killed one year before the cyclic peak, while those of lynx varied from 0.3 to 1.2 hares/d, with the highest one year after the peak. Maximum kill rates by both predators were greater than their energetic needs. The functional response of coyotes was equally well described by linear and type-2 curves, and that of lynx was well described by a type-2 curve. Kill rates by coyotes were higher during the increase in density of hares than during the cyclic decline, while the reverse was true for lynx. Coyotes killed more hares early in the winter, and cached many of these for later retrieval. Lower densities of hares were associated with longer reactive distances of both predators to hares, but with little apparent change in time spent searching or handling prey. In summary, our data show that the two similarly sized predators differed in their foraging behavior and relative abilities at capturing alternative prey, leading to different patterns in their functional responses to fluctuations in the density of their preferred prey.},

  abstract                 = {Upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) caused by Mycoplasma agassizii has been hypothesized to contribute to the decline of some wild populations of gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus). However, the force of infection (FOI) and the effect of URTD on survival in free-ranging tortoise populations remain unknown. Using four years (2003-2006) of mark-recapture and epidemiological data collected from 10 populations of gopher tortoises in central Florida, USA, we estimated the FOI (probability per year of a susceptible tortoise becoming infected) and the effect of URTD (i.e., seropositivity to M. agassizii) on apparent survival rates. Sites with high (> or = 25\%) seroprevalence had substantially higher FOI (0.22 +/- 0.03; mean +/- SE) than low (< 25\%) seroprevalence sites (0.04 +/- 0.01). Our results provide the first quantitative evidence that the rate of transmission of M. agassizii is directly related to the seroprevalence of the population. Seropositive tortoises had higher apparent survival (0.99 +/- 0.0001) than seronegatives (0.88 +/- 0.03), possibly because seropositive tortoises represent individuals that survived the initial infection, developed chronic disease, and experienced lower mortality during the four-year span of our study. However, two lines of evidence suggested possible effects of mycoplasmal URTD on tortoise survival. First, one plausible model suggested that susceptible (seronegative) tortoises in high seroprevalence sites had lower apparent survival rates than did susceptible tortoises in low seroprevalence sites, indicating a possible acute effect of infection. Second, the number of dead tortoise remains detected during annual site surveys increased significantly with increasing site seroprevalence, from approximately 1 to approximately 5 shell remains per 100 individuals. If (as our results suggest) URTD in fact reduces adult survival, it could adversely influence the population dynamics and persistence of this late- maturing, long-lived species.},

Namely, given a partial series of event-time observations, believed governed by a known process, what range of model parameters might plausibly explain it? This problem is first introduced in the simple context of an immigration-death process, in which only deaths are recorded, and is then extended through the introduction of birth, standard and power-law logistic growth, and an `odd-even effects' quantum optics model. The results show that simple Metropolis Hastings samplers can be applied to provide useful information on models containing a high degree of complexity. Specific problems highlighted include: the potentially poor mixing qualities of simple Metropolis Hastings samplers; and, that heavily non-symmetric full likelihood surfaces may inflict substantial bias on their associated marginal distributions.},

We find that the population trajectory estimated from the simple model is in general agreement with the trajectory from the catch-age analysis. We suggest that the simple model can serve as both an intuitive and quantitative aid to interpreting results from the complex model. For example, the contrast between models highlights the role of technically complex assumptions. To some extent, errors in the age structure data cancel in calculating the mean age. Thus, our analysis suggests options available for investigating stocks where only summary age data are reliable.},

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to $\infty$. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

However, studies supporting this hypothesis predominantly have been conducted on small, isolated patch reefs. Here, we searched for evidence of spatially density-dependent predation on the continuous reefs of the Netherlands Antilles in a study of a dominant planktivore, the blue chromis (Chromis cyanea). Across space, we quantified both the patterns of loss from site-attached aggregations of C. cyanea through time and the behavioral reaction of predators to these aggregations. Looking across C. cyanea densities, we found that loss from aggregations was not characteristic of direct density dependence, but instead was commonly inversely related to density. Individual C. cyanea in larger aggregations were less likely to be lost from the group than were individuals in smaller aggregations. Thus, the observed density dependence increased spatial heterogeneity of C. cyanea. Predators showed behaviors that were consistent with these demographic patterns. Using remote videography, we quantified predator visitation and strike rates across a range of C. cyanea aggregation sizes. Predators consistently visited and struck at individuals in C. cyanea aggregations in a pattern that was strongly inversely density dependent, suggesting that aggregation is an effective means of minimizing per capita risk of predation for prey reef fish. Differences in spatial distribution of resources for predators (i.e., prey fish) between continuous and patch reef habitats may explain the difference between these results and those of previous studies on patch reefs.},

No prior experience with lattice is required to read the book, although basic familiarity with R is assumed. The book contains close to 150 figures produced with lattice. Many of the examples emphasize principles of good graphical design; almost all use real data sets that are publicly available in various R packages.

We developed a cohort-based framework for quantifying the influence of an external supply of colonists and subsequent density-independent and density-dependent mortality on local abundance. Two complementary approaches --- based on limitation and elasticity --- revealed the nature of interactions and nonlinearities among these processes. Data for an Indo-Pacific reef fish were used to document the settler-survivor relationship and to quantify natural variation in settlement. Limitation by density-dependence was two-fold and 20-fold greater than by supply or density-independent mortality, respectively. Elasticity analyses showed that adult abundance was 40% more sensitive to small proportionate changes in supply than in density-dependence. These techniques provide a way to compare across systems, which could enhance our ability to draw general conclusions regarding the processes that shape local abundance of species with open populations.},

  abstract                 = {A sequential fisheries model relates observed data to the biological dynamics of an underlying stock. Either model component, dynamic or observational, can be subject to statistical variation. Current fisheries literature includes models with (1) variable dynamics and no observation error, (2) deterministic dynamics and observations subject to measurement error, and (3) combined dynamic and measurement variability. This paper presents a general framework for developing sequential fishery models and estimating model parameters from available data. The framework encompasses most traditional stock assessment models and suggests new, potentially useful extensions. It generalizes the conventional definition of state space model to include nonlinear equations with nonnormal error. The paper rigorously compares two paradigms (KF: Kalman filter, EV: errors in variables) used for parameter estimation. Each paradigm is formulated in both frequentist and Bayes contexts, where Bayes is shown to be most appropriate for the EV paradigm. Model design concepts are illustrated with a simple example oriented to catch data and a more complex example with catch-at-age data. Because the framework forces essential questions to be asked about underlying processes, observed data, and sources of variability, it can help delineate the limits of current knowledge and establish rational priorities for future data collection.},

We use state space models and simulation-estimation cycles to evaluate the performance of catch-age analysis. In particular, we design a simulation model with realistic measurement and process error. We then examine how effectively unknown parameters and population sizes can be obtained from an estimation model simplified to conform with common assumptions. We describe circumstances in which, simultaneously with all other parameters, M is estimable from traditional catch-age data. Increased fishing contrast improves estimates of some model parameters, but not M. The variance ratio rho relating process error in recruitments with measurement error in the abundance index must be specified in the estimation. We consider both true and ad hoc choices for rho. In general, estimation models perform better when the true rho is specified and measurement error is low, so that recruitment error is the dominant source of model variability. Thus, well-designed data collection programs are critical to the correct interpretation of actual fishery data.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

  abstract                 = {Many species with complex life histories can respond to risk by adaptively altering the timing of key life history switch points, including hatching. It is generally thought that such hatching plasticity involves a trade-off between embryonic and hatchling predation risk, e.g., hatching early to escape egg predation comes at the cost of increased vulnerability to hatchling predators. However, most empirical work has focused on simply detecting predator-induced hatching responses or on the short-term consequences of hatching plasticity. Short-term studies may not allow sufficient time for hatchlings to exhibit compensatory responses, which may extend to subsequent life stages and could alter the nature of the trade-offs associated with hatching plasticity. In this study, we examine the consequences of predator-induced hatching plasticity through the larval stage to metamorphosis in the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis. To do this we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated initial larval size and density (mimicking the effects of egg predators) and the presence of aquatic predators. We expected that predator-induced hatchlings (because they are less developed and smaller) would experience higher per capita predation rates and a longer larval period and thus would exhibit lower survival to metamorphosis in the presence of aquatic predators than larger, more developed, later hatched larvae. Surprisingly, we found that predator-induced hatchlings survived better, not worse, than hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. These results motivated us to develop a model parameterized from additional experiments to explore whether a combination of mechanisms, compensatory growth, and density- and size-specific predation, could give rise to this pattern. Predicted survival probabilities from the model with compensatory growth were consistent with those from the field experiment: early hatched larvae grew more rapidly through vulnerable size classes than later hatched larvae, resulting in higher survival at metamorphosis. Thus, in this system, there does not appear to be a trade-off in vulnerability between egg and larval predators. Instead, our results suggest that the cost that balances the survival benefit of hatching early to evade egg predators arises later in the life history, as a result of smaller size at metamorphosis.},
